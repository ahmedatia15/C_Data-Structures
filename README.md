# C_Data-Structures

This repository contains implementations of various fundamental data structures in C. These data structures are essential building blocks for many computer science and software engineering tasks.

## Data Structures Included

1. **Double Linked List (DoubleLinkedList)**

   - Description: A data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each linked to both its previous and next element.
   - File: `DoubleLinkedList.c`

2. **Queue using an Array (QueueArray)**

   - Description: A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
   - File: `Queyearray.c`

3. **Single Linked List (SingleLinkedList)**

   - Description: A data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each linked to its next element.
   - File: `SingleLinkedList.c`

4. **Dynamic Stack using an Array (StackArrayDS_with_dyn.M)**

   - Description: A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This version allows dynamic resizing.
   - File: `StackArrayDS_with_dyn.c`

5. **Static Stack (StaticStack)**
   - Description: A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This version has a fixed size.
   - File: `StaticStack.c`

## Usage

You can compile and run each data structure separately. Here's a general way to compile C programs using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):

```shell
gcc -o program_name program_name.c
```
